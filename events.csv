Registration has closed, but resources provided by NIAID’s 3D Printing and Biovisualization Program are being made publicly available here.","3D,visualization,STEM",
STRUCTBIOLIG LISTSERV,Advances in COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment Enabled by Structural Biology Research,2021/5/11,2021/5/12,1620741600,Virtual Workshop,https://www.aps.anl.gov/sites/www.aps.anl.gov/files/APS-Uploads/WK9%20Agenda.pdf,Virtual Event,No,"Broadly, the workshop will present areas where structural biology research, including macromolecular crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy, intersects with in vivo, in vitro, and in silico studies of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. More precisely, the topics will include (a) viral biology, (b) vaccine, therapeutic, and diagnostic antibody studies, and (c) small-molecule drug discovery as it relates to viral proteases and other viral proteins. In addition, as this year's events emphasize the need for a coordinated, long-term strategy to prevent future pandemics of zoonotic origin, a broader One Health perspective on viral pathogens will be presented.","structural biology,crystallography,SARS-CoV-2,drug discovery",
