Over the past decade, high-throughput assays have become pervasive in biological research due to both rapid technological advances and decreases in overall cost. To properly analyze the large data sets generated by such assays and thus make meaningful biological inferences, both experimental and computational biologists must understand the fundamental statistical principles underlying analysis methods. This course is designed to build competence in statistical methods for analyzing high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology.

Topics Include:
• The R environment for statistical computing and graphics
• Introduction to Bioconductor
• Review of basic statistical theory and hypothesis testing
• Experimental design, quality control, and normalization
• High-throughput sequencing technologies
• Expression profiling using RNA-Seq and microarrays
• In vivo protein binding using ChIP-Seq
• High-resolution chromatin footprinting using DNase-Seq
• DNA methylation profiling analysis
• Integrative analysis of data from parallel assays
• Representations of DNA binding specificity and motif discovery algorithms
• Predictive modeling of gene regulatory networks using machine learning
• Analysis of posttranscriptional regulation, RNA binding proteins, and microRNAs
Format: Detailed lectures and presentations by instructors and guest speakers will be combined with hands-on computer tutorials. The methods covered in the lectures will be applied to example high-throughput data sets.","biostatistics,genomics",

Reproducibility can be defined as the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials and procedures as were used by the original investigator. Reproducibility has become a priority at NIH, requiring that researchers adopt best practices to facilitate replicable research early on. In bioinformatics, that requires adopting computational tools that allow analysis pipelines to be reused and providing sufficient documentation for increased transparency.

Categorical data is the data type consisting of categorical variables or of data converted into categories or groups. Categorical data analysis is vital and useful statistical analysis in clinical research since categorical data occupies a large portion of the data we collect and use. This course will start by introducing different types of categorical data and characteristics, contingency tables, and probability distribution to learn how to calculate and interpret some useful statistics such as odds ratio and relative risk. The last section will cover different types of statistical testing for categorical data by cases. Each example will include a hands-on component using R Studio to perform the analysis. 
 
Topics that will be covered in this course include: 
- Analyzing contingency tables (positive/negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, Type I/II error, joint, marginal, conditional association)
- Measuring the strength of association (odds ratio, relative risk)
- Statistical testing of independence (cases with nominal large sample size data and small sample size data, cases with stratified and paired data, cases with ordinal data)","biostatistics,data analysis",
