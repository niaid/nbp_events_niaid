NIAID BioIT listserv,Introduction to UNIX,2020/3/27,2020/3/27,1585303200,GoToWebinar,https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/7767092381286077453,Seminar,yes,"The raw output of biological research is usually in the form of large text files. UNIX is particularly suited to working with such files and has several powerful and flexible commands that can process such data. In UNIX user types everything and it may seem archaic to use a keyboard to issue commands today. However, it’s much easier to automate keyboard tasks than mouse tasks and this course is a gentle introduction on UNIX commands can be combined and automated to handle biological data.

The first part of the course will focus on the file management and parsing of text files in UNIX environment. Second part of the course will focus on simple scripting to manipulate. The course is designed for beginners and will consist hands on exercises along with the lectures. At the end of the course participants will learn basic UNIX commands and will appreciate the real strength of UNIX on how commands can be combined in an almost unlimited fashion.

Fortunately, these master genes and related regulatory networks can be recovered by examining the statistical relationships of gene expression and inferring from known knowledge. In this webinar, we will review the best available approaches and tools to find master genes from the crowd.","networks,gene expression",
