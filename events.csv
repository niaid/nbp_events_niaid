Topics include introduction to Jupyter Notebook, basic intro to the python programming language, data and project organization, data exploration, automation, publishing, and sharing. This seminar will condense the Data Carpentry Reproducible Science Jupyter workshop held in Berkeley, CA in 2017 & 2018 (https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum). Students will receive a Jupyter Notebook with all steps taught in the class for further study and practice.

The course will conclude with pathway and network analysis on the resultant 'gene' list. Participants will gain experience in cloud computing and data visualization tools. All class exercises will be self-contained units that include example data (e.g., Illumina paired-end data) as well as detailed instructions for installing all required bioinformatics tools.",,
