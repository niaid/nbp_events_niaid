Our microbiomes change every day through the foods we eat, the environments we experience, even the people we live and work with. The implications of microbiome changes for our health are just beginning to be understood.

Through the American Gut Project—the largest crowdsourced and crowdfunded citizen-science project yet conducted—we now know about the microbiomes of many types of people, from the healthiest athletes and centenarians to the sickest cancer and intensive-care patients. Diet has an especially profound effect on our microbiomes, often outweighing the effects of disease or medications. This raises the prospect of a system for real-time microbiome analysis that helps guide our daily decisions in a way that optimizes our microbiomes for life-long wellness.

A live Q&A session will follow the presentation, offering you a chance to pose questions to our expert keynote speaker.","microbiome,analysis",
