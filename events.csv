The course will conclude with pathway and network analysis on the resultant 'gene' list. Participants will gain experience in cloud computing and data visualization tools. All class exercises will be self-contained units that include example data (e.g., Illumina paired-end data) as well as detailed instructions for installing all required bioinformatics tools.",,

We are now collecting project proposals focusing on building tools and pipelines for advanced analysis of biomedical datasets including text, images, next generation sequencing data, proteomics, and metadata. Proposals for tutorial pipelines and educational tools for advanced analysis are also welcome. We will choose five to eight proposals for the hackathon. We will create groups of five to six individuals who have various backgrounds and applicable expertise to work on each project. Cloud infrastructure will also be provided to turn your idea into a working prototype. You can either choose to lead your project team or recommend someone. Otherwise, we will attempt to find a suitable team lead. The hackathon runs from 9 am - 5 pm each day with an optional social event on the evening of the second day.

Submit your project proposal here https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Feb2019_NCBI_hackathon!  Submissions are due by January 7th 2019.","hackathon,biomedical data",

University of Maryland
College Park, MD 20742",https://education.umd.edu/LONGITUDINAL-2019,Seminar,yes,"This three-day short course is intended as both a theoretical and practical introduction to modern statistical techniques for longitudinal data analysis as it pertains to methods regularly used in educational, behavioral, and social science research. An understanding of modern longitudinal data analytic methods will be developed by relating it to participants’ existing knowledge of traditional statistical methods, particularly multiple linear regression. A participant’s experience in this workshop will be enhanced by additional prior coursework or knowledge of advanced statistical techniques such as multilevel modeling. 

An outline of topics covered during the three-day short course follow sound principles of any data analytic endeavor. The course begins with discussion of longitudinal designs, data management, and exploratory data analysis. Linear mixed-effects models focusing on specifying a model for individuals, means, variances, and covariances will be presented. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation approaches will be discussed as a precursor to drawing inferences through the hypothesis testing paradigm. On the third day, nonlinear longitudinal models will be presented and many extensions to basic models will be discussed.

Examples used in this short course draw primarily from social and behavioral science research, including the fields of education and psychology. Datasets will be made available to participants as well as R scripts to run the examples and annotated output. Throughout the course, participants will be able to practice exercises using R statistical software and because it is freely available, participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops with R pre-installed to perform these exercises. Participants will be instructed on how to download R prior to the course.","statistics,data analysis,R",

address simpler issues on the spot and follow up on more complex
questions after the Walk-In.

BIOINFORMATICS-SIG-L listserv,BioThings API: Building a FAIR API Ecosystem for Biomedical Knowledge,2019/01/16,2019/01/16,1547596800,"NCI Shady Grove Campus, Rm. 1W032-34",https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/CBIITSpeakers/CBIIT+Speaker+Series+Page,Seminar,yes,"Building a web-based API (Application Programming Interface) has been rapidly adopted in the bioinformatics field as a new way of disseminating the underlying biomedical knowledge. While researchers benefit from the simplicity and the high accessibility (A) of available APIs, the findability (F), interoperability (I) and reusability (R) across APIs are largely not well-handled by the community. BioThings API project (http://biothings.io) is tasked to build a FAIR API ecosystem to better serve the underlying inter-connected biomedical knowledge. BioThings API provides three components in its API development ecosystem. First, it provides a family of high-performance APIs for accessing up-to-date annotations for genes, genetic variants, chemicals and drugs. Second, BioThings API packages its API-development best practice into a reusable SDK (Software Development Kit) to help other bioinformaticians to build the same high-quality API to distribute their own specific knowledge. Third, BioThings API provides a platform to foster the findability and interoperability across the community-developed biomedical APIs. Through the SmartAPI application (http://smart-api.info), it provides tools for authoring API metadata following the community supported OpenAPI standard and hosts standardized interactive API documentation. It also defines a set of OpenAPI extensions to provide biomedical-specific semantic annotations, such as what specific biomedical identifiers an API parameter accepts and what specific biomedical entity types an API response contains. Powered by these semantic annotations, a new web application called BioThings Explorer was developed to allow researchers to navigate the scope of the distributed biomedical API landscape and build the desired knowledge extraction workflows by identifying and combining required APIs.
