Using GeneGrid, one can quickly perform trio analysis, case-control studies, identify somatic SNPs and visualize and dynamically interact with these results in the context of other integrated Genomatix data content including: genomic annotation, biological pathways, and the supporting biomedical literature. GeneGrid also includes the ability to generate variant report summaries and provides link-outs to genetic testing providers. For an overview of the GeneGrid technology we invite you to visit: http://www.genomatix.de/solutions/genegrid.html
The training course will consist of a GeneGrid overview lecture and instructor-led demonstration of how to import VCF and BAM files into the GeneGrid platform, followed by a hands-on training demonstrating the use of GeneGrid for variant annotation and analysis. At the end of the course, students will have learned how to:

*import VCF and BAM files into the GeneGrid platform;
*view VCF sample statistics and the associated metadata;
*run a sample comparison;
*annotate and filter variants;
*view annotated variant data in the Genomatix Genome Browser;
*use the results management features;

METAGENOTE refers to the collection of metadata from genomics studies using a web-based notebook. METAGENOTE facilitates the annotation of datasets to ensure that metadata is stored in one centralized location for each group and automates the submission of files to the SRA. This tool, developed by NIAID, is freely accessible to all NIH researchers. 

The webinar will cover easy ways to annotate your samples and submit them to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) using METAGENOTE. 

By attending this webinar, you can expect to learn:
• What is METAGENOTE and why do I want to use it? 
• How do I import metadata from Excel files? 
• How do I share annotated sample group tables with lab members? 
• How do I submit my sample data to the SRA database automatically?","genomic data,SRA",
