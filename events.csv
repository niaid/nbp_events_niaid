MICROBIOME listserv,Generating High-quality Genome Drafts from Uncultured Microbiome Samples with a Single Shotgun Experiment,2019/02/13,2019/02/13,1550016000,Online only,https://www.10xgenomics.com/event/generating-high-quality-genome-drafts-from-uncultured-microbiome-samples/,Webinar,yes,"This webinar will feature a presentation on a recently published method for de novo assembly of microbial genome drafts using short read sequencing. The method uses Chromium Linked-Read sequencing and a novel computational analysis pipeline, Athena, to construct high-quality microbial genome drafts of metagenomic communities sampled directly from their environments. In uncultured samples from human stool, Athena produced individual genome drafts with high contiguity (>200-kb N50, fewer than ten contigs), even for bacteria with relatively low raw short-read sequence coverage. Compared with results from existing short-read and synthetic long-read metagenomic sequencing techniques, the Athena assemblies are the most contiguous reported to date.","de novo assembly,Athena,short-read sequencing",

We are now collecting project proposals focusing on building tools and pipelines for advanced analysis of biomedical datasets including text, images, next generation sequencing data, proteomics, and metadata. Proposals for tutorial pipelines and educational tools for advanced analysis are also welcome. We will choose five to eight proposals for the hackathon. We will create groups of five to six individuals who have various backgrounds and applicable expertise to work on each project. Cloud infrastructure will also be provided to turn your idea into a working prototype. You can either choose to lead your project team or recommend someone. Otherwise, we will attempt to find a suitable team lead. The hackathon runs from 9 am - 5 pm each day with an optional social event on the evening of the second day.

Submit your project proposal here https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Feb2019_NCBI_hackathon!  Submissions are due by January 7th 2019.","hackathon,biomedical data",

University of Maryland
College Park, MD 20742",https://education.umd.edu/LONGITUDINAL-2019,Seminar,yes,"This three-day short course is intended as both a theoretical and practical introduction to modern statistical techniques for longitudinal data analysis as it pertains to methods regularly used in educational, behavioral, and social science research. An understanding of modern longitudinal data analytic methods will be developed by relating it to participants’ existing knowledge of traditional statistical methods, particularly multiple linear regression. A participant’s experience in this workshop will be enhanced by additional prior coursework or knowledge of advanced statistical techniques such as multilevel modeling. 

An outline of topics covered during the three-day short course follow sound principles of any data analytic endeavor. The course begins with discussion of longitudinal designs, data management, and exploratory data analysis. Linear mixed-effects models focusing on specifying a model for individuals, means, variances, and covariances will be presented. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation approaches will be discussed as a precursor to drawing inferences through the hypothesis testing paradigm. On the third day, nonlinear longitudinal models will be presented and many extensions to basic models will be discussed.

Examples used in this short course draw primarily from social and behavioral science research, including the fields of education and psychology. Datasets will be made available to participants as well as R scripts to run the examples and annotated output. Throughout the course, participants will be able to practice exercises using R statistical software and because it is freely available, participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops with R pre-installed to perform these exercises. Participants will be instructed on how to download R prior to the course.","statistics,data analysis,R",
