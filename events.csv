Topics include introduction to Jupyter Notebook, basic intro to the python programming language, data and project organization, data exploration, automation, publishing, and sharing. This seminar will condense the Data Carpentry Reproducible Science Jupyter workshop held in Berkeley, CA in 2017 & 2018 (https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum). Students will receive a Jupyter Notebook with all steps taught in the class for further study and practice. 

This seminar will be concurrently webcast for those who cannot attend in person (Register here: http://bit.ly/nih-python-register) ",reproducibility,

The course will conclude with pathway and network analysis on the resultant 'gene' list. Participants will gain experience in cloud computing and data visualization tools. All class exercises will be self-contained units that include example data (e.g., Illumina paired-end data) as well as detailed instructions for installing all required bioinformatics tools.",,

STRUCTBIOLIG listserv,Structure and Signaling Mechanisms of G Protein-Coupled and b-Arrestin-Biased Chemokine Receptors,2018/12/05,2018/12/05,1543968000,"NIH Main Campus, Building 10, Lipsett Auditorium",,Lecture,no,"Most chemokine receptors are G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), and are best known for their role in controlling cell migration in the context of immune system function. They are also implicated in many diseases particularly inflammatory diseases as well as cancer and HIV, making them important therapeutic targets. Recent structural and biophysical studies have revealed that the recognition interface between chemokines and receptors is very large and characterized by more complex epitopes than previously believed.  In this presentation, our current understanding of how chemokines bind and activate their receptors will be described, as well mechanisms for inhibiting chemokine receptor signaling with orthosteric and allosteric ligands.  Common and unique features of G protein-coupled versus b-arrestin-biased receptors will also be described, focusing on CXCR4 (a GPCR) and the b -arrestin-biased, atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) both of which respond to the chemokine CXCL12.",chemokine,

We are now collecting project proposals focusing on building tools and pipelines for advanced analysis of biomedical datasets including text, images, next generation sequencing data, proteomics, and metadata. Proposals for tutorial pipelines and educational tools for advanced analysis are also welcome. We will choose five to eight proposals for the hackathon. We will create groups of five to six individuals who have various backgrounds and applicable expertise to work on each project. Cloud infrastructure will also be provided to turn your idea into a working prototype. You can either choose to lead your project team or recommend someone. Otherwise, we will attempt to find a suitable team lead. The hackathon runs from 9 am - 5 pm each day with an optional social event on the evening of the second day.

Submit your project proposal here https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Feb2019_NCBI_hackathon!  Submissions are due by January 7th 2019.","hackathon,biomedical data",
