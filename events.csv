The course will conclude with pathway and network analysis on the resultant 'gene' list. Participants will gain experience in cloud computing and data visualization tools. All class exercises will be self-contained units that include example data (e.g., Illumina paired-end data) as well as detailed instructions for installing all required bioinformatics tools.",,

Join us at the NIH Library for a moderated discussion session to help us better understand the current interest in and uptake of ELNs within the NIH community. Information gathered during these sessions will also help us plan a one-day ELN meeting in 2019 to further explore current ELN practices and opportunities at NIH.",ELN,

We are now collecting project proposals focusing on building tools and pipelines for advanced analysis of biomedical datasets including text, images, next generation sequencing data, proteomics, and metadata. Proposals for tutorial pipelines and educational tools for advanced analysis are also welcome. We will choose five to eight proposals for the hackathon. We will create groups of five to six individuals who have various backgrounds and applicable expertise to work on each project. Cloud infrastructure will also be provided to turn your idea into a working prototype. You can either choose to lead your project team or recommend someone. Otherwise, we will attempt to find a suitable team lead. The hackathon runs from 9 am - 5 pm each day with an optional social event on the evening of the second day.

Submit your project proposal here https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Feb2019_NCBI_hackathon!  Submissions are due by January 7th 2019.","hackathon,biomedical data",
MICROBIOME listserv,Mechanisms involved in the prevention of type 1 diabetes onset by Lactobacillus johnsonii N6.2,2018/12/14,2018/12/14,1544745600,Webinar,https://cbiit.webex.com/cbiit/j.php?MTID=me7fa4356a7aafc80a26cf708855040dd,Seminar,yes,"A myriad of complex host-microbe interactions occur in the gastrointestinal tract, some of which have been found to alter the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in animal models. Several microbiome studies have corroborated these findings in subjects with T1D. In Biobreeding diabetes-prone (BBDP) rats, it was  found a strong negative correlation between administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii N6.2 and the development of autoimmunity (T1D). Mechanistically, it was determined that L. johnsonii N6.2 alters the host kynurenine pathway through modulation of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme. Metabolomics and immunophenotyping assays indicated shifts in the metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, as well as significant shifts in several immune cell frequencies in human subjects. In rodent models of disease, it was recently found that L. johnsonii N6.2 is able to dampen caspase 1-mediated inflammasome activation as well as reduce mTOR activating phosphorylations. Dr. Lorca's lab is currently focused on the identification of the bacterial effector molecules responsible for the effects observed using a variety of omics techniques.","microbiome,gastrointestinal",

By launching an interactive analysis environment with a Jupyter Notebook on Firecloud - the Broad Institute’s open-source platform for accessing data, code, and processing resources - users can explore the workflows of their peers, share workspaces with their collaborators, and even reproduce published results. This webinar focuses on reproduction of results in a recent study (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/13/300905) on the correlation between certain genetic variants and a common congenital heart condition. This exercise will serve as an instructive example for accessing data and methodologies shared on FireCloud, and running a notebook in order to manipulate and extract data.",Jupyter,
