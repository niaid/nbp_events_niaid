The course will conclude with pathway and network analysis on the resultant 'gene' list. Participants will gain experience in cloud computing and data visualization tools. All class exercises will be self-contained units that include example data (e.g., Illumina paired-end data) as well as detailed instructions for installing all required bioinformatics tools.",,

Over the past decade, high-throughput assays have become pervasive in biological research due to both rapid technological advances and decreases in overall cost. To properly analyze the large data sets generated by such assays and thus make meaningful biological inferences, both experimental and computational biologists must understand the fundamental statistical principles underlying analysis methods. This course is designed to build competence in statistical methods for analyzing high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology.

Topics Include:
• The R environment for statistical computing and graphics
• Introduction to Bioconductor
• Review of basic statistical theory and hypothesis testing
• Experimental design, quality control, and normalization
• High-throughput sequencing technologies
• Expression profiling using RNA-Seq and microarrays
• In vivo protein binding using ChIP-Seq
• High-resolution chromatin footprinting using DNase-Seq
• DNA methylation profiling analysis
• Integrative analysis of data from parallel assays
• Representations of DNA binding specificity and motif discovery algorithms
• Predictive modeling of gene regulatory networks using machine learning
• Analysis of posttranscriptional regulation, RNA binding proteins, and microRNAs
Format: Detailed lectures and presentations by instructors and guest speakers will be combined with hands-on computer tutorials. The methods covered in the lectures will be applied to example high-throughput data sets.","biostatistics,genomics",
