UNIX is particularly suited to working with such files and has several powerful and flexible commands that can process such data. In UNIX, user types everything and it may seem archaic to use a keyboard to issue commands. However, it’s much easier to automate keyboard tasks than mouse tasks and this course is a gentle introduction on how UNIX commands can be combined and automated to handle biological data.",UNIX,
