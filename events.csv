The course will conclude with pathway and network analysis on the resultant 'gene' list. Participants will gain experience in cloud computing and data visualization tools. All class exercises will be self-contained units that include example data (e.g., Illumina paired-end data) as well as detailed instructions for installing all required bioinformatics tools.",,

We are now collecting project proposals focusing on building tools and pipelines for advanced analysis of biomedical datasets including text, images, next generation sequencing data, proteomics, and metadata. Proposals for tutorial pipelines and educational tools for advanced analysis are also welcome. We will choose five to eight proposals for the hackathon. We will create groups of five to six individuals who have various backgrounds and applicable expertise to work on each project. Cloud infrastructure will also be provided to turn your idea into a working prototype. You can either choose to lead your project team or recommend someone. Otherwise, we will attempt to find a suitable team lead. The hackathon runs from 9 am - 5 pm each day with an optional social event on the evening of the second day.

Submit your project proposal here https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Feb2019_NCBI_hackathon!  Submissions are due by January 7th 2019.","hackathon,biomedical data",

are invited to stop by and discuss problems and concerns, from scripting
problems to node allocation, to strategies for a particular project, to
anything that is affecting your use of Helix or Biowulf. We'll try to
address simpler issues on the spot and follow up on more complex
questions after the Walk-In.

No appointments are necessary, and all problems are welcome.

Look for the signs saying 'NIH HPC Walk-In Consults' on the tables to
find us!","HPC,Helix,Biowulf",
